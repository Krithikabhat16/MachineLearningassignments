A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.

CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vison that
includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).

A neural network is a system of hardware and/or software patterned after the operation of neurons in the human brain. Traditional neural networks are not ideal for 
image processing and must be fed images in reduced-resolution pieces. CNN have their “neurons” arranged more like those of the frontal lobe, the area responsible for 
processing visual stimuli in humans and other animals. The layers of neurons are arranged in such a way as to cover the entire visual field avoiding the piecemeal image 
processing problem of traditional neural networks.
