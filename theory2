What is Occam's Razor method?

Occam's Razor method states that the learner needs to prefer the simplest hypothesis that fits the data. It is a problem solving principle
that believes that the simplest solution tends to be the right one.
When presented with competing hypothesis, to solve a problem, one should choose a solution with fewest assumptions. Shorter hypothesis fits the training data.
